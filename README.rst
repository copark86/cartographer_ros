Purpose
=======

`Cartographer`_ is a system that provides real-time simultaneous localization
and mapping (`SLAM`_) in 2D and 3D across multiple platforms and sensor
configurations. This project provides Cartographer's ROS integration.

Getting started
===============

* Learn to use Cartographer with ROS at `our Read the Docs site`_.
* Please join the `mailing list`_ and ask questions.

Cartographer ROS Integration
============================

Cartographer is a system that provides real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in 2D and 3D across multiple platforms and sensor configurations. This project provides Cartographer’s ROS integration.

System Requirements
===================

See Cartographer’s system requirements.

The following ROS distributions are currently supported:

Indigo
Kinetic

Building & Installation
=======================

We recommend using wstool and rosdep. For faster builds, we also recommend using Ninja.

   # Install wstool and rosdep.
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y python-wstool python-rosdep ninja-build

   # Create a new workspace in 'catkin_ws'.
   mkdir catkin_ws
   cd catkin_ws
   wstool init src

   # Merge the cartographer_ros.rosinstall file and fetch code for dependencies.
   wstool merge -t src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googlecartographer/cartographer_ros/master/cartographer_ros.rosinstall
   wstool update -t src

   # Install deb dependencies.
   # The command 'sudo rosdep init' will print an error if you have already
   # executed it since installing ROS. This error can be ignored.
   sudo rosdep init
   rosdep update
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=${ROS_DISTRO} -y

   # Build and install.
   catkin_make_isolated --install --use-ninja
   source install_isolated/setup.bash

Running the demos
=================

Now that Cartographer and Cartographer’s ROS integration are installed, download the example bags (e.g. 2D and 3D backpack collections of the Deutsches Museum) to a known location, in this case ~/Downloads, and use roslaunch to bring up the demo:

   # Download the 2D backpack example bag.
   wget -P ~/Downloads https://storage.googleapis.com/cartographer-public-data/bags/backpack_2d/cartographer_paper_deutsches_museum.bag

   # Launch the 2D backpack demo.
   roslaunch cartographer_ros demo_backpack_2d.launch bag_filename:=${HOME}/Downloads/cartographer_paper_deutsches_museum.bag

   # Pure localization demo: We use 2 different 2D bags from the Deutsche
   # Museum. The first one is used to generate the map, the second to run
   # pure localization.
   wget -P ~/Downloads https://storage.googleapis.com/cartographer-public-data/bags/backpack_2d/b2-2016-04-05-14-44-52.bag
   wget -P ~/Downloads https://storage.googleapis.com/cartographer-public-data/bags/backpack_2d/b2-2016-04-27-12-31-41.bag
   # Generate the map: Run the next command, wait until cartographer_offline_node finishes.
   roslaunch cartographer_ros offline_backpack_2d.launch bag_filenames:=${HOME}/Downloads/b2-2016-04-05-14-44-52.bag
   # Run pure localization:
   roslaunch cartographer_ros demo_backpack_2d_localization.launch \
      bag_filename:=${HOME}/Downloads/b2-2016-04-27-12-31-41.bag \
      map_filename:=${HOME}/Downloads/b2-2016-04-05-14-44-52.bag.pbstream

   # Download the 3D backpack example bag.
   wget -P ~/Downloads https://storage.googleapis.com/cartographer-public-data/bags/backpack_3d/b3-2016-04-05-14-14-00.bag

   # Launch the 3D backpack demo.
   roslaunch cartographer_ros demo_backpack_3d.launch bag_filename:=${HOME}/Downloads/b3-2016-04-05-14-14-00.bag

   # Download the Revo LDS example bag.
   wget -P ~/Downloads https://storage.googleapis.com/cartographer-public-data/bags/revo_lds/cartographer_paper_revo_lds.bag

   # Launch the Revo LDS demo.
   roslaunch cartographer_ros demo_revo_lds.launch bag_filename:=${HOME}/Downloads/cartographer_paper_revo_lds.bag

   # Download the PR2 example bag.
   wget -P ~/Downloads https://storage.googleapis.com/cartographer-public-data/bags/pr2/2011-09-15-08-32-46.bag

   # Launch the PR2 demo.
   roslaunch cartographer_ros demo_pr2.launch bag_filename:=${HOME}/Downloads/2011-09-15-08-32-46.bag

   # Download the Taurob Tracker example bag.
   wget -P ~/Downloads https://storage.googleapis.com/cartographer-public-data/bags/taurob_tracker/taurob_tracker_simulation.bag

   # Launch the Taurob Tracker demo.
   roslaunch cartographer_ros demo_taurob_tracker.launch bag_filename:=${HOME}/Downloads/taurob_tracker_simulation.bag
   The launch files will bring up roscore and rviz automatically.
